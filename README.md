2.Udacity course of How to use Git and GitHub was very interesting for me because it was my first steps in learning Git and GitHub. As for me, it was really deep and useful. Best of all I liked quizzes and practical part of the course.

3.I was a little bit confused answering the questions about my reflections in course. That is why I have to improve my skills more and more.
